# Annotating Change Points in Grafana

Change points found by `analyze` can be exported
as Grafana annotations using the `--update-grafana` flag:

```
$ otava analyze <test or group> --update-grafana
```

The annotations generated by Otava get the following tags:
- `otava`
- `change-point`
- `test:<test name>`
- `metric:<metric name>`
- tags configured in the `tags` property of the test
- tags configured in the `annotate` property of the test
- tags configured in the `annotate` property of the metric

Additionally, the `annotate` property supports variable tags:
- `%{TEST_NAME}` - name of the test
- `%{METRIC_NAME}` - name of the metric
- `%{GRAPHITE_PATH}` - resolves to the path to the data in Graphite
- `%{GRAPHITE_PATH_COMPONENTS}` - splits the path of the data in Graphite into separate components
  and each path component is exported as a separate tag
- `%{GRAPHITE_PREFIX}` - resolves to the prefix of the path to the data in Graphite
  (the part of the path up to the metric suffix)
- `%{GRAPHITE_PREFIX_COMPONENTS}` - similar as `%{GRAPHITE_PATH_COMPONENTS}` but splits the prefix
of the path instead of the path

## Example

> [!TIP]
> See [otava.yaml](../examples/graphite/otava.yaml) for the full Graphite & Grafana example.

Start docker-compose with Graphite in one tab:

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/graphite/docker-compose.yaml up --force-recreate --always-recreate-deps --renew-anon-volumes --build
````


Run otava in another tab:

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/graphite/docker-compose.yaml run otava otava analyze my-product.test --since=-10m --update-grafana
```

Expected output:

```bash
time                       run    branch    version    commit      throughput    response_time    cpu_usage

Open local [Grafana](http://localhost:3000) in your browser (use default `admin/admin` credentials), open
`Benchmarks` dashboard, and see your data points and annotations on both charts.:
